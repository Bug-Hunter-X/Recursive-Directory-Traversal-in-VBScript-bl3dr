This repository demonstrates a common issue in VBScript: the lack of built-in recursive directory traversal in the `Get-ChildItem` equivalent. The `recursive_traversal_bug.vbs` file shows an attempt to list all files within a directory and its subdirectories, which fails due to the missing recursion. The solution, `recursive_traversal_solution.vbs`, provides a corrected version using a recursive function.
